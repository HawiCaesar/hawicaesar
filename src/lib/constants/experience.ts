-  Built the first production web application for Site using React, MobX, and Styled Components in collaboration with the product manager and
another engineer. This enabled doctors to run clinical trials on any desktop browser, which reduced costs for Medable and contributed to Medable
securing funding to expand digital and decentralized clinical trials.
-  Developed the redesign and rebuild of Medable's Site experience using **TypeScript, React, and TailwindCSS** with a focus on accessibility and
performance, in collaboration with a senior frontend engineer. This effort supported Medable's One, One and One decentralized clinical trial
strategy, which secured a GSK Flu clinical trial. Highlighted in recognition posts by the [product manager](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/erikamotley_medable-for-sitesintuitive-seamless-activity-7336141432379887618-QLp4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABQ7OM0BTjaDKtsOpttyciL-DbngQtgIqv4) and [CEO](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michellelongmire_teammedable-activity-7328082425832493056-kFid?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABQ7OM0BTjaDKtsOpttyciL-DbngQtgIqv4).
-  Developed the in-built training feature allowing easier understanding on how to use the Medable for sites experience.          
- Re-designed and implemented reference to language and region codes in the custom web framework with the aim of allowing standardisation **(using Intl.Locale as per ECMAscript standard)**, reducing code complexity allowing unit tests to be written and impacting customer value as more languages with scripts can be supported
