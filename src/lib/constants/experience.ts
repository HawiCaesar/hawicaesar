- ♦ Developed the initial production web application for Site using **React, Mobx, and Styled Components** in collaboration with the product manager and another engineer. This initiative enabled doctors to conduct clinical trials on any desktop browser, resulting in cost reduction for Medable. This work contributed to Medable secure funding to further digital and decentralized clinical trials.
- ♦ Helped lead the redesign and rebuild of Medable's new Site experience using **Typescript, React, TailwindCSS** with accessibility and performance in mind as part of the One, One and One decentralized clinical trial strategy, collaborating with a senior frontend engineer. This effort was instrumental in securing a $50M Flu study for Medable. User interface examples from this work are available in [**the product manager's recognition post**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/erikamotley_medable-for-sitesintuitive-seamless-reliable-activity-7336141432379887618-QLp4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABQ7OM0BTjaDKtsOpttyciL-DbngQtgIqv4) and [**the CEO's announcement**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michellelongmire_teammedable-activity-7328082425832493056-kFid?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABQ7OM0BTjaDKtsOpttyciL-DbngQtgIqv4). Moreover, I developed the in-built training feature allowing easier understanding on how to use the Medable for sites experience.
- ♦ Built a feature allowing Site users to view survey task response data and audit history entries increasing traceability and accountability in clinical trials on the web version of the Site application.           
- ♦ Re-designed and implemented reference to language and region codes in the custom web framework with the aim of allowing standardisation **(using Intl.Locale as per ECMAscript standard)**, reducing code complexity allowing unit tests to be written and impacting customer value as more languages with scripts can be supported
