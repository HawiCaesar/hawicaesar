- ♦ Developed the initial production web application for Site using React, Mobx, and Styled Components in collaboration with the product manager and another engineer. This initiative enabled doctors to conduct clinical trials on any desktop browser, resulting in cost reduction for Medable. This work contributed to Medable securing $91M in funding to further digital and decentralized clinical trials.
- ♦ Helped lead the redesign and rebuild of Medable's new Site experience using Typescript, React, TailwindCSS with accessibility and performance in mind as part of the One, One and One decentralized clinical trial strategy, collaborating with a senior frontend engineer. This effort was instrumental in securing a $50M Flu study for Medable. User interface examples from this work are available in the product manager's recognition post and the CEO's announcement. Moreover, I developed the in-built training feature allowing easier understanding on how to use the Medable for sites experience.
