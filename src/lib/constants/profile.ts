  about: `
I work as a full stack **software engineer** with 8+ years of experience. A **custodian for quality product experiences** with the ability to develop and maintain high-quality, resilient, accessible, and performant web applications. I've moved beyond exploring AI tools into actually building with them, completing projects across RAG, LLM generation, LangChain text chunking, and observability as a deliberate expansion of my engineering toolkit. I have 7 years of remote work experience.
